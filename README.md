# Introduction to Deep learning: Skooldio

This is a repository for the Skooldio's Introduction to Deep Learning course. It includes
the notebooks for the course as follows:

- Introduction to Pytorch
- Introduction to Deep Learning for Thai Handwriting Recognition (Part 1: Overview)
- Introduction to Deep Learning for Thai Handwriting Recognition (Part 2: More layers, Dropout, Augmentation)
- Introduction to Deep Learning for Second-Hand Car Price Prediction

## How to use

You can open each notebook and click the Google Colab badge to open the notebook on Google Colaboratory.

- `01_tensor_operations.ipynb` - Introduction to Pytorch
- `02_handwritten_recognition.ipynb` - Dense neural network to classify Thai handwritten numbers
- `03_handwritten_recognition_explore.ipynb` - Experiments with more layers, dropout, and augmentation
- `student_notebooks` - Notebooks for the students to fill in

## Datasets

- `thai-handwritten-dataset` is a collection of Thai handwritten numbers
  for Handwriting Recognition task from [`kittinan/thai-handwriting-number`](https://github.com/kittinan/thai-handwriting-number)
- `rodkaidee-dataset` is a second-hard car price dataset from Kaidee website in CSV format

## Articles

You can checkout `articles` folder which contains articles about introduction, classification, and handwritten recognition.
